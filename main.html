			Roses are among the most popular and widely recognized flowers in the world, admired for their beauty, fragrance, and symbolism. Belonging to the genus Rosa in the Rosaceae family, there are over 300 species and thousands of cultivated varieties. Roses come in a wide range of colors including red, pink, white, yellow, and orange, each carrying its own meaningâ€”red for love, white for purity, yellow for friendship, and so on. Native primarily to Asia, roses have also been found in Europe, North America, and northwest Africa. Many roses are prized not only for their ornamental value but also for their fragrance, which is extracted and used in perfumes and cosmetics. They play a significant role in culture and tradition, often featured in art, literature, celebrations, and ceremonies across the globe.
